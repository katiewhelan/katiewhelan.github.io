# Independent Study
*****

### Part 1 - Learning Kotlin & Swift
To get exposure to Kotlin and Swift I completed two different tutorials through [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). I completed the The Complete Android 10 & Development [Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/android-kotlin-developer/), and then The Complete IOS App Development [Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/).  Each course started with the basics and progressed to creating several small applications.

### Part 2 - Creating an IOS App
After completing the courses on Kotlin and Swift I developed an app that allows the user to track collections of objects. I chose to complete this app in Swift as I own an Iphone. I have used different apps like IMDB or GoodReads to track movies and books but wanted a singular location where I could access and track multiple types of items.
