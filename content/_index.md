# Hello!
***

{{< rawhtml >}}
<br/>
<p>I am a software engineer and developer with expertise in C#/.net, Javascript, Vue, and SQL. Over the last eight years, I have advanced back-end development and user experience in various industries.

Iâ€™m now seeking to apply these skills in a mission-driven environment that values community and inclusion. This is motivated, in part, by my experience co-leading company-wide DEI efforts and promoting computer science and STEM to girls and the public.

When I am not at my computer, I am usually helping neighbors troubleshoot IT issues, exploring nature, or capturing the view through my <a href="https://www.kathrynwhelanphotography.com">camera lens</a>. </p>
