# Hello!
***

{{< rawhtml >}}
<br/>
<p>I am a software developer with expertise in C#/.net, Javascript, Swift, and Kotlin. After five years of working on back-end development and improving user experience, I'm looking forward to applying my skills to mobile development. This spring I will earn a <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/msse">Master's of Science in Software Engineering</a> from the University of Minnesota, which compliments and builds on my training at <a href="https://www.primeacademy.io/">Prime Digital Academy</a> (2015). I am based in Minneapolis, MN and on weekends I enjoy exploring the many bike trails and parks in the region.</p>
